# Matplotlib-Challenge
## Observations and Insights 
---

* Over 100 measurements were taken for each drug Regimen with some even having more than 200 measurments taken.
* The sex ratio of the mice was close to an equal 50/50 split between male and female
    * sets sex as a control and prevents mouse sex from affecting study results
* Box Plot shows no outliers for Capomulin, Ramicane, and Ceftamin regimens and only one outlier for Infubinol regimen
    * data shows study was conducted in a very controlled manner with the lack/minimization of outliers
* Tumor Volume decreased the longer a mouse stayed on the Capomulin Regimen
* Average Tumor Volume had a positive correlation with a mouse's Weight
    * best fit slope is 0.95 showing almost a direct 1:1 positive correlation between weight and avg. volume
        * if weight increases by 1 g, avg. tumor vol. should increaes by 0.95 mm3
    * the linear model was only 70% accurate (r squared)
        * model isn't the most accurate model
